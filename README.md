# jax-spp
My initial attempt at extending the [jax.experimental.stax](https://github.com/google/jax) library with a Spatial Pyramid Pooling feature, based on my rough understanding of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4729) by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren and Jian Sun.  

There are most certainly errors and bugs, but if you let me know or send me a pull request, I'll try to fix it/use your suggestions!
